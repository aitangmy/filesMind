# filesMind (Native macOS Rebuild)

filesMind is now a native macOS application stack built with SwiftUI + Swift Package Manager.

## Active Stack

- UI: SwiftUI
- Core app: Swift 5.9+ (`@Observable`, async/await)
- Data: SQLite + GRDB
- Parsing/Indexing/Search: native modules under `native/Packages/Sources`

Legacy Python/Vue/Tauri code has been removed from this branch.

## Repository Layout

- `native/Packages/` Swift package workspace (main app + modules + tests)
- `scripts/test_all.sh` Native CI script (Swift build/test)

## Build (macOS)

```bash
cd native/Packages
swift build
```

## Run Tests

```bash
cd native/Packages
swift test
```

## Output Binary (debug)

After build, the executable is generated by SwiftPM under:

- `native/Packages/.build/debug/FilesMindApp`

## Notes

- This branch is focused on App Store compliant native architecture.
- No local HTTP server, no Python runtime sidecar, no Vue frontend pipeline.
